# CartFull
## CS203 Assignment 2.
The assignment to develop a web-app using the previous investigational proposal and,
and the project proposal.

Our project is called "CartFull", and the goal of this app is to make an interactive
grocery shopping list, with tick boxes to keep track of your shop. Though the most
important part is that the list will be able to report to the user where they can fill
their shopping trolley for the lowest price.

This will be done by separated tables in a database. It will make a total from each
different supermarket table and then show the end-user how which establishment is
cheapest, and how much it will cost.
 
To get started, run the db.py script. This will initialise and create the database
that the program relies on.
